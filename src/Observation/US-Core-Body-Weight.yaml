description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch body weight observations associated with a patient. Defines constraints on Observation to represent body weight observations with a standard LOINC code and UCUM units of measure. This profile is derived from the US Core Vital Signs Profile.
